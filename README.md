##Cleanining Data README
The cleaning data script, tidytext.R, goes through the included UCI data files and creates a tidy data set that rolls the data up to average values and other top level values instead of lower grains for easier consumption and analyses of the data.

Please read the codebook.md for more information as well as the README in the UCI data folder. Both are excellent sources for explaining more about how the data is collected and formed.

##TLDR
-Script: tidytext.R

-Documentation: UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt and codebook.md
